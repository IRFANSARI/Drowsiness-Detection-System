# Drowsiness-Detection-System

## Motivation:
  Car accidents are a big problem in the world and one of the many reason of car accident is driver being in drowsy state.
  According to an article from [sleepfoundation.org](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/drowsy-driving-is-a-factor-in-21-percent-of-fatal-crashes), researchers estimated that around 21% of fatal car crashes involves a person driving in drowsy.

## Intuition
  To prevent such accident, I wanted to build a system that detects driver's face and check if he is in drowsy state or active state. To achieve these functionalities, I used Python and OpenCV for this project.
